# Roman Numerals kata

A kata to practice TDD as an approach to writing code.

## Outcomes

* Practice TDD using a simple exercise as a means to explore it.
* Make a Roman Numeral converter, as they are few and far between in this world.

## Methods to implement

### to_roman(number)

This should take a regular (or 'Arabic') number and return a string with the
Roman Numeral representation of that number.

For instance:

* 1 -> I
* 4 -> IV
* 2999 -> MMCMXCIX

Only numbers between 1 and 3999 need to be supported.
